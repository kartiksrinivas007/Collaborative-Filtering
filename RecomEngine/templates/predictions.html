    <h1>Finding Closest Movies</h1>
    <hr style = "height:2px;border-width:0;color:white ;background-color: white; margin-left:2px;margin-right:65px">
    <p>We need a measure of "distance" between movies !, how do we do this ? one way to go would be to first plot the movies in the feature space 
        and then find the Euclidean distance between them. This is a very simple way to do it, but it is not the best way to do it. For example, if 
        Ram and Shyam both watched Movie A and Movie B , and both of them rated Movie A twice as much as Movie B, then this means that Movie A and Movie B
        actually are quite similar to each other , but Ram gave Movie A a rating of 2.5, while Shyam gave it 5 stars!. All this actually means is that Ram is a tough 
        Rater, and Shyam is a very easy Rater. Euclidean distance cannot capture this information, since it looks at the absolute differences in ratings.
        Therefore, we need to find a way to combine the ratings of the two users to find a measure of similarity between the two movies.

    <h2> The Cosine Similarity</h2>
    <hr style = "height:2px;border-width:0;color:white ;background-color: white; margin-left:2px;margin-right:65px">
    If you would have noticed, the directions of the Movies A and B in the previous examples are actually the same! So the best way to see similarity, 
    independent fo the "toughness" of a particular user, is to look at the <b>Angle</b>  between them! The smaller the angle between the two movies, the more similar they are.
    Hey ! Wait a minute ! That sounds familiar ! smaller the angle , greater the value ?! Simlarity is behaving like a <b>Cosine Function!</b>
    <br>
    \[ CS(\vec{m_i},\vec{m_j}) = \frac {\vec{m_i} \cdot \vec{m_j}}{||m_i||\cdot ||m_j||} \]
    \[ \text{Distance of movie i from movie j} = d_{ij} = 1 - CS(\vec{m_i},\vec{m_j}) \]
