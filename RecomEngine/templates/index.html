    <p> Welcome to the My movie recommendation system, I  have built a Collaborative filtering Engine. What this means is that a single rating from a particular user
        affects the ratings of all the other users who have rated the same movies. There are two ways to implement this, In this system I have used the <b>KNN Algorithm.</b>
        The second algorithm uses a matrix factorization algorithm (using ML and pytorch) and can be found on the <a href = "https://github.com/kartiksrinivas007/Collaborative_Filetring.git">Github repo</a> for this project.

        <h2 style = "margin-left: 10px">The Dataset</h2>
        <hr style = "height:2px;border-width:0;color:white ;background-color: white; margin-left:2px;margin-right:65px">
        <p> This Model uses the publicly available <a href = "https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/">MovieLens dataset</a>, it has been trained using approximately 10,000 movies.
            The dataset is divided into three parts, the first part contains information about the movies, the second part contains information about the users and the third part contains
            the ratings of the users.

   <h2>Plotting the Dataset</h2>
   <hr style = "height:2px;border-width:0;color:white ;background-color: white; margin-left:2px;margin-right:65px">
   How do we Plot Movies? More importantly why do we want to Plot Movies ?. Its simple, plotting movies is a good way to understand the data, and how it is distributed.
   Okay , but what are the axees? For imlpementing a KNN - algorithm , I need to know the <b>distance between movies..</b> How do I do that?. The axees are the <b>User ratings!</b>
   Basically if Ram rated Movie A as 2.5 stars and Shyam rated Movie A as 5 stars, then Movie A would have co-ordinates (2.5,5)! But this dataset has nearly 610 users ! (611 including the reader :) )
   It follows that each movie is a vector in 610-dimensional space !
    \[ \vec{m_i} \in \mathbb{R}^{610}\]
    \[ r_{ij} = \text{Rating given by user j to Movie i }\]
    \[\vec{m_i} = (r_{i1},r_{i2}, \cdots r_{in})\]
